Jessy Token is a Solana-based utility-meme project that helps crypto traders stay motivated after losses.

**Jessy** is not just a meme ‚Äî it's an ecosystem of support, education, and reward:

- **Rebound** ‚Äî Claim airdrops based on your on-chain losses.

## üí° MVP Purpose

This MVP demonstrates the **Rebound logic flow**:

1. User connects a Phantom wallet.
2. Applies for Rebound analysis.
3. A simulated process begins:
   - DEX/CEX transactions analyzed.
   - % losses calculated.
   - Level assigned (based on loss %).
   - Smart contract requests airdrop.
4. When analysis completes, a **CLAIM** button appears.
5. After claiming ‚Äî user's JSY balance is shown near the wallet address.
6. A reminder to complete the **Academy** is shown to encourage education.

Everything is wrapped in a crypto-themed interface ‚Äî designed for **Web3 familiarity and funder clarity**.
